\section{Global description}
For our project we chose to do the geometric modeling assignment, for which the description read:\\
\\
\textit{Make a geometry editor where the geometry is based on stacking simple building blocks. The editor should allow for efficient construction of complex scenes.}\\
\\
Instead of just constructing meaningless structures, we wanted to stimulate the user to build something meaningful. This inspired us to create \name, a game in which the player must construct a bridge over a cliff such that a train can pass over it. The bridge is constructed from a number of simple building blocks. The difficult part is that physical effects are applied on the bridge, such as gravity on the weight of the building blocks, the maximum force that can be applied on  block before it breaks, and the weight of the train riding over the bridge. Altogether, these effects might cause the bridge to collapse, so the goal is to build a well designed bridge that can withstand these effects so that the train may safely pass.
